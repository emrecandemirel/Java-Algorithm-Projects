The important thing about your assignment is the implementation of your hash 
function. Main duty of the hash function is generating a digestion respect to the 
input data. In this project, the digestion becomes an index value for your table and 
the input data is the word that you are indexing. If your hash function is a loose one, 
the overlapping ratio of the words increase. Then it causes a bad distribution of the 
indexed words and increases the search time. So we would like to have a hash 
function such that distributes the input words in a finely manner as much as 
possible. Briefly, you had better to make a little research on hash functions in order 
to implement yourâ€™s a good one.
